Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer who is passionate about functional programming, especially in Ruby and Elixir. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to learn new things.

I believe that functional programming is not just a programming paradigm, but also a way of thinking about programming problems. In my opinion, functional programming provides a more declarative and composable way of building software, which makes it easier to reason about and test.

In my GitHub profile, you'll find various projects that showcase my skills and interests.
